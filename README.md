# filemaker
 Solutions and sample code related to FileMaker development.  All work is compatible with FileMaker v20 and beyond.

 
 **APILabs** - A tool to configure and explore API without having to write scripting.

 **CKEditor** - Custom functions and scripting for the integration of CKEditor into a FileMaker solution.  CKEditor is externally hosted.  Custom functions provide the html and javascript for a webviewer. Scripting moves data to and from a field using the Perform Javascript in Web Viewer script step.

 **CalendarComparison** - Sample file of a calendar interface built natively in FileMaker.  There are better ways to do this type of thing today and layout styling options have made this work to slow to be usable.  So this file stands as an example of knowledge for what once was and food for future thought.   Sample data is provided thru the APITestWithFakeData example mentioned above.  Calendar content is provided as JSON.

 **CatalogingThemeStyles** - It helps to be able to see a theme when making changes or fixing problems.  Here is a template to help sort that out.

 **DrillDownExample** - I simple example of a drill down list using a portal and a couple ways to drive it.  One example is scriptless.  One example makes use of the Execute FileMake Data API script step to pull data on demand.

 **DynamicUniversalValuelists** - An example of a dynamic value list that does not require a relationship, and so is accessible regardless of context.

 **MethodsOfIteration&Enumeration** - A code example looking at different methods old, new, and experimental.

 **NativeFieldAuditing** - My favorite way to do change audit.  No scripting, no custom functions.

 **TamingUserImages** - A method to clarify and correct image and file uploads.

 **TinyMCE** - Custom functions and scripting for the integration of TinyMCE into a FileMaker solution.  TinyMCE is externally hosted.  Custom functions provide the html and javascript for a webviewer. Scripting moves data to and from a field using the Perform Javascript in Web Viewer script step.
